# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree
## Project 1 - Navigation
> An agent in a square environment containing yellow and blue bananas is required to nagivate through and collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue ones and the wall.

 ## Project 3 - Collaboration and Competition
> Two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.
